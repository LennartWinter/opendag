If you wish to continue your studies after obtaining your diploma, you may consider pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science or web design.

There are two learning paths available for this program:

Bol (Beroeps Opleidende Leerweg): In a bol program, you attend school five days a week. During certain periods in the second and third year, you participate in internships at a BPV (Beroepspraktijkvorming) company, gaining practical experience in the industry.

Bbl (Beroeps Begeleidende Leerweg): In a bbl program, you work full-time at an accredited training company while also attending school one or two days a week. What you learn at school can be immediately applied in practice at your workplace.

In addition to the core and specialized components of your training, you will also complete elective modules, which are a mandatory part of every program. These elective modules can focus on further specialization in your profession or prepare you for further education. Sometimes, you can also choose elective modules that align with your specific interests, hobbies, and career goals.

The exact requirements for elective modules may vary by educational level and are determined by the government. You usually complete between 1 and 4 elective modules, depending on the level and duration of your program. The requirement for elective modules remains constant regardless of the duration of your training. For more information about elective modules, you can consult your study career advisor.
