During your training as a software developer, you frequently work in a team setting. You learn how to organize projects to develop applications and constantly monitor the functionality of your apps and software.

In the first year of the program, you primarily establish the foundations of programming and markup languages. In the second year, you dive into frameworks commonly used by companies, such as Laravel, Vue, React, Xamarin, and Bootstrap.

In addition to specific subject-related knowledge, you also take general courses such as Dutch, English, mathematics, career orientation, and citizenship.

If you're curious about what it's like to study at the vocational school (mbo), you can sign up for a shadow day at the mbo of your choice. On such a day, you'll get an authentic experience of mbo and student life. You'll attend classes and meet fellow students. It's a great way to discover if a vocational education suits you.
